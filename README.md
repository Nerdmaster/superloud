THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A REALLY LOVELY RUBY-BASED IRC LIBRARY CALLED Net::YAIL.  YAIL CAN BE FOUND
AT https://github.com/Nerdmaster/ruby-irc-yail OR ALSO DOCS ARE FOUND AT http://ruby-irc-yail.nerdbucket.com/

I FOUND OUT TODAY IT IS CALLED YAIL NOT YELL BUT I STILL LIKE CAPITAL LETTERS

THIS EXAMPLE IS HEAVILY FULL OF PLAGIARISM BUT I DO NOT REALLY CARE I LIKE TO STEAL IT IS A COOL CRIME

HOW TO USE ME:

* FIRST GET YOURSELF THE YAIL STUFF: "gem install net-yail" OR "sudo gem install net-yail" DEPENDING ON YOUR USER PRIVILEGES
* CLONE THIS REPOSITORY IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW THEN YOU SHOULD NOT USE GITHUB OH MY GOD
* RUN THE SCRIPT DUH: ruby bot_runner.rb --network irc.somewhere.org --channel "#bots"
