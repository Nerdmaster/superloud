THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A REALLY LOVELY RUBY-BASED IRC LIBRARY CALLED Net::YAIL.  YAIL CAN BE FOUND
AT https://github.com/Nerdmaster/ruby-irc-yail OR ALSO DOCS ARE FOUND AT http://ruby-irc-yail.nerdbucket.com/

THIS IS AN AWESOME BOT!

I FOUND OUT TODAY IT IS CALLED YAIL NOT YELL BUT I STILL LIKE CAPITAL LETTERS

THIS EXAMPLE IS HEAVILY FULL OF PLAGIARISM BUT I DO NOT REALLY CARE I LIKE TO STEAL IT IS A COOL CRIME

HOW TO USE ME:

* FIRST GET YOURSELF THE YAIL STUFF: "gem install net-yail" OR "sudo gem install net-yail" DEPENDING ON YOUR USER PRIVILEGES
* CLONE THIS REPOSITORY IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW THEN YOU SHOULD NOT USE GITHUB OH MY GOD
* RUN THE SCRIPT DUH: ruby bot_runner.rb --network irc.somewhere.org --channel "#bots"
* YOU MIGHT NEED TO CREATE A DIRECTORY AT THE TOP LEVEL, `db/`, HMM.  NERDMASTER SHOULD REALLY FIX THIS.
* YOU MAY STORE FILES TO CONFIGURE ME!
  * `config/ignores.txt`: NEWLINE-SEPARATED LIST OF REGEXES FOR IGNORING PEOPLE
  * `config/password.txt`: PASSWORD FOR SUPER-USER COMMANDS LIKE RELOAD_IGNORES

HOW TO LEARN YAIL:

* STOP SUCKING AT EVERYTHING.  THIS IS KEY TO LEARNING AWESOME NEW THINGS LIKE YAIL.
* LOOK AT bot_runner.rb BECAUSE IT SHOWS MAKING HOOKS AND FILTERS AND WHATEVER
* WHEN YOU ARE READY, LOOK AT louds/loudbot.rb.  IT HAS LOTS OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT BACK THE BOT.
* WHEN YOU'RE REALLY AWESOME-SMART, LOOK AT louds/commands.rb.  THIS IS A REALLY DUMB BUT POWERFUL
  DYNAMIC COMMAND HANDLER.  IT SHOULD BE REWRITTEN BUT IT WORKS WELL ENOUGH FOR IDIOTS LIKE
  NERDMASTER AND THEREFORE IS WAY MORE AWESOME THAN ANYTHING **YOU'LL** EVER NEED.
